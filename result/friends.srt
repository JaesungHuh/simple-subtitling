00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:04,165
spk_2 : That wasn't a real date.

2
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:10,191
spk_2 : What the hell do you do on a real date?

3
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,432
spk_1 : Shut up and put my table back.

4
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:12,493
spk_3 : Okay.

5
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:15,436
spk_4 : All right, kids, I gotta get to work.

6
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:19,840
spk_4 : If I don't input those numbers, doesn't make much of a difference.

7
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:26,407
spk_0 : So, like, you guys all have jobs?

8
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,782
spk_1 : Yeah, we all have jobs.

9
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,184
spk_1 : See, that's how we buy stuff.

10
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:34,147

11
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:35,628
spk_0 : Wow.

12
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:37,229
spk_0 : What, I've seen you in anything?

13
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,210
spk_2 : Oh, I doubt it.

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,571
spk_2 : Mostly regional work.

15
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:43,454
spk_1 : Oh, hey, unless you happen to catch the Wee Ones production of Pinocchio.

16
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,257
spk_4 : Look, Geppetto, I'm a real live boy.

17
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,861
spk_2 : I will not take this abuse.

18
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,122
spk_4 : You're right, I'm sorry.
